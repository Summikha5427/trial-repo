Events
Events Bubbling => has to be stopped using EventObject(e)
  In react(e) is a synthetc Event
basics
components
Hook
  UseState: external Function .hooking function for other components
   // Use the useState hook to initialize state variables
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [text, setText] = useState('Hello, React!');

  In react don't mutate(change) the state but instead make a copy of the element and make a new states

  Forms:
    how components interact and know about each other state....
Form has a default feature that it reloads. to stop reloading need to use e.preventDefault();

lifting State: (children to parent) its a flow but react only works upwards to downwards


child To Parents: functionProps(FunctionsasProps)
              down to up flow
    ({})  =>  Fucntions as functionProps
 addVideo(child) => App.js(parent)
Child to Child (siblings):

UseEffect:
  anEffect after the component is rendered...
  useEffect Hook works first when the component is mounted/rendered
  secondly it runs the number of times there is a change in the dependency array(deitableVideo)
